     <p> This era talks about The Beatles and their quick rise to fame. In March 1963, The Beatles released their debut album in England. It immediately hit number one in the U.K. Charts. By late 1963, they were already very popular in England, but they weren't big in America yet. This all changed when U.S. radio stations  played "I Want To Hold Your Hand." This gave them their first no. 1 single in America. They then commanded the  youth's attention and this launched the phenomenon known as "Beatlemania." Their recording company EMI's American counterpart, "Capitol" finally released their debut album in the U.S. after seeing the massive success of the single. This shot to number one in America, only being dethroned months later by their second album. In 1964, they went to perform live on The Ed Sullivan Show which was watched by over 1/3 of the American population at that time. This event, made them household names, not just in America or England, but around the world too.  Between January 1 and December 31 of 1964, 19 Beatles songs debuted on the Billboard top 100 singles chart. Six songs ("I Want to Hold Your Hand", "She Loves You", "Can't Buy Me Love", "Love Me Do", "A Hard Day's Night," and "I Feel Fine") made it to the top spot, while all 19 tracks reached a position of #35 or higher. These singles alongside, "And I Love Her", "Please Please Me", "Eight Days A Week", and "Twist and Shout" are some of the most recognizable Beatles songs from this period.   <div class="songlists">
