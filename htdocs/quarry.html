     <p> This era talks about The Beatles and how they started. The Quarrymen started as a band formed by John Lennon. In July 1957, The Quarrymen performed at St. Peter's Church. A young Paul McCartney watched this and joined the band right after. Then, he brought his friend George Harrison along to join the band. Between 1957 and 1960, many of the original members would leave. This would result in the lineup of; John Lennon on Rhythm Guitar, Paul McCartney on Rhythm Guitar, George Harrison on Lead Guitar, Stuart Sutcliffe on Bass Guitar, and Pete Best on Drums. They would go and perform in Hamburg, Germany. Stuart Sutcliffe would leave the band to go to art school, after the performances in Germany. Before he left, Stu would propose the name "Silver Beetles" as their new name. This name eventually turned into "The Beatles". The small attention they got from Hamburg led them to be the backing band for Tony Sheridan in his song, "My Bonnie". This recording caught the attention of Brian Epstein, who soon became their manager. Epstein made an appointment with EMI producer George Martin, but Martin didn't think they were special. Soon, he warmed up after joking and interacting with the boys, except for Pete Best. Pete Best would be kicked out of the band as his drumming was not great inside the studio. Eventually, the boys took in Richard Starkey as their new drummer, known by his stage name; Ringo Starr. In 1963, they would start recording their first album, "Please Please Me".

<p> During this time, The Beatles did not release any albums. They only made compositions during this time such as, "In Spite of All The Danger", "One After 909", and "Hello Little Girl". Pictured above are photos of John (20), Paul (18), George (17), and Ringo (20) during this time. </p>
