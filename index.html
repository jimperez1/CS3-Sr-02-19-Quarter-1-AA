        <p> This era talks about The Beatles and how they started out. The Quarryman started out as a band formed by
          John Lennon. On July 1957, The Quarrymen performed at St. Peter's Church. A young Paul McCartney watched this,
          and joined the band right after. Then, he brought his friend George Harrison along to join the band. They
          would go and perform in Hamburg, Germany. This led them to backing up Tony Sheridan in his song, "My Bonnie".
          Stuart Sutcliffe would leave the band to go to art school. This recording caught the attention of Brian
          Epstein, who soon became their manager. Epstein made an appointment with EMI producer George Martin, but
          Martin didn't think they were special. Soon, he warmed up, but Pete Best would be kicked out of the band as
          his drumming did not translate well from their live shows. Eventually, the boys took in Richard Starkey as
          their new drummer, known by his stage name; Ringo Starr. </p>

        <p> This era talks about The Beatles and their quick rise to fame. The Beatles were very popular in the U.K.
          during the early part of 1963, but they weren't big in America yet. This all changed when U.S. radio stations
          played "I Want To Hold Your Hand." This gave them their first no. 1 single in America. They then commanded the
          youth's attention and this launched the phennomenon known as "Beatlemania." During this time, they went to go
          perform live on The Ed Sullivan Show which was watched by over 1/3 of the American population at that time.
          This helped their second album, "With The Beatles", dethrone the number one album on the Top 100 chars at the
          time, their debut album, "Please Please Me". Then, in 1964 the boys released their third album, "A Hard Day's
          Night." This album was the soundtrack of their first movie of the same title. This shot up to number one and
          dethroned their second album. </p>

        <p> This era talks about The Beatles' peak, touring-wise. They were considered as the number one band of all
          time, during this period. They had movies, television shows, and even toys in their name. This would also mark
          the beginning of their experimental phase, but this growth would not be fully realized until the next era.
          This era would not come without its hardships. During the late part of 1965, The Beatles started becoming
          tired of touring. Then, they underwent a disastrous tour in the Philippines which resulted in them getting
          smuggled out of the country in order to escape. There was also a controversy regarding John Lennon. In an
          interview, he said that The Beatles were bigger than Jesus. This sparked outrage in many people. Many people
          harrassed them and even tried to kill them. At the end of 1966 they announced that they would stop touring,
          altogther. Many fans thought that The Beatles had broken up because of this. </p>

        <p> This era talks about The Beatles' switch from touring giants to studio lab rats. In this era, The Beatles
          started experimenting more in the studio. They discovered new instrument techniques and new recording methods.
          This enlightenment, led to the creation of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. This album led to the summer
          of love and the birth of counterculture in the youth. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band brought a new
          flavor to the already emerging psychedelic rock scene. LSD, Acid, and other drugs and their effects are
          essential to the sound of the psychedelic genres. They also used uncommon instruments like the flute, the
          clavioline, and the sitar which was used previously in the two albums which preceded Sgt. Pepper. This
          enhanced the growth seen on previous albums like Rubber Soul and Revolver. </p>

        <p> This era talks about the final era of The Beatles. After the death of their manager Brian Epstein in 1967,
          the band were in a rough position after many problems in both their professional and personal lives. This led
          to Paul McCartney and John Lennon starting a record company of their own. This proved to be very disastrous in
          the end, because the band could not manage themselves or the comapny. Music-wise, this era is the peak of The
          Beatles. The group's last two albums "Abbey Road" and "Let It Be", are what the previous albums were building
          up to. Many disputes happened during this time. This worsened the already rocky relationship between the four
          bandmates, which sadly lead to their breakup in 1970. Before this, in 1969, they performed their final live
          performance on top of their company's headquarters. This is known as "The Rooftop Performance" and is widely
          regarded as their last hurrah. </p>
